This setup used python 3.10.9, but other versions may work as well (not tested).
Main dependencies:
- ptQT5
- numpy

Configurations:
- Control implementation can be changed inside controlAlgorithms.py
- Environment configurations are in simulationEnvironment.py

How it works:
- Click anywhere in the screen to set that as target location. The car should move towards the target while avoiding obstacles

Demo (controller code may be different from the repo):
